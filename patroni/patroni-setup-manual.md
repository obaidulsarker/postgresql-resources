## 1.	Introduction

Patroni is a cluster manager that can customize and automate the deployment and maintenance of PostgreSQL HA (High Availability) clusters. It ensures that PostgreSQL databases remain operational and resilient to failures. Patroni works by utilizing a distributed consensus mechanism to manage the configuration and state of a PostgreSQL cluster, facilitating automatic failover in case of primary node failures.
